Introduction to Project:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● Hostel Management system is a java-based application which aims at
computerization of current procedure of allocating hostel rooms.
● Currently the process involves students filling up the forms and submitting
them in respective hostel offices which involves a lot of paperwork, hence
less efficient!

Types of Users
1. Student (can only view his/her room allotment details such as which room is allocated to him/her and payment updates)
2. Admin (can allocate room, cancel allotment, update room, and so on)

Login Page
-To open project, admin and student must enter userid, username and password to login in respective account.
-Only Admin can register a student and allocate a room and data of student is stored in database.
-When student is registed, he/she is assigned a userid, username and password to log in his/her account.
-When a user wants to check his/her status, student must login using his/her userid, userame and password.

-If and only if the user exists in DB and password entered is correct, he/she will be able to
login, otherwise appropriate error message is displayed.

- When admin open his.her account, ADD, UPDATE, SEARCH, DELETE buttons will be enable. Whenever, a user login,ADD, UPDATE, SEARCH, DELETE buttons
will be disable becasue student is not given access to add, update or delete data. 
- When a student login, he/she can view his/her data on profile.

● Once a hostel becomes full the admin won’t be able to allocate a room
for student. So he/she will be asked to select another room.
● If a student is already allocated a room, he can’t apply to any other hostel.
